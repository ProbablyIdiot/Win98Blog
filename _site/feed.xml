<h3 id="step-1---install-jekyll-feed">Step 1 - Install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-feed</code></h3>

<p>You might think “Why would I want an RSS feed? I want a newsletter!”. However, this is the simplest way of doing it. At the moment there are no plugins or tutorials for directly sending emails from your jekyll site (or none that I could find), therefore, the easiest way to make a newsletter is to copy your RSS feed.</p>

<p>Just follow the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed">jekyll-feed Github</a> to install the plugin, and check that it works by going to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yoururl.com/feed.xml</code>. If it worked, you should see something like this, with the text containing all blog posts you have previously made.<img src="/assets/postImages/feedXml.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="step-2---setup-a-mailing-website-to-mirror-your-rss-feed">Step 2 - Setup a mailing website to mirror your RSS feed</h3>

<p>This is the step that has taken forever to figure out. The most popular option for setups like this is <a href="https://mailchimp.com">Intuit Mailchimp</a>, however, they can get quite pricey and I prefer something open-source. At first I tried the <a href="[GitHub - ElliotKillick/rss2newsletter: Convert RSS/Atom feed to email newsletters](https://github.com/ElliotKillick/rss2newsletter)">RSS2Newsletter</a> project, however I could not manage to get it to install on my raspberry pi. I then spent ages looking through google for a free alternative. This is when I stumbled upon <a href="https://rssto.email">rssto.email</a>. A FOSS project hosted on Github that will convert any RSS feed into a newsletter and deliver it straight to your inbox. They have a simple user interface, and allow you to embed a link for your RSS feed straight into your blog. This can be annoying to setup, however, so look at step 3 for how to do that.</p>

<h3 id="step-3---setting-up-a-link-for-rsstoemail">Step 3 - Setting up a link for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rssto.email</code></h3>

<p>Head to their website, and click the EMBED ON YOUR BLOG button. Input the link to your RSS feed and then copy the link.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/postImages/rssToEmail.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then use this code (replacing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yourURL.com</code> with the link you copied) to create a newsletter button on your blog:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">action=</span><span class="s">"https://rssto.email"</span> <span class="na">method=</span><span class="s">"GET"</span> <span class="na">target=</span><span class="s">"_blank"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"hidden"</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"url"</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">"yourURL.com"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;button</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"submit"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Sign up to the newsletter!<span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There you go! You should now have a fully functional newsletter for your users to keep up with all your blog posts. My next blog should be on adding comments, so keep an eye out for that.</p>]]></content><author><name>ProbablyIdiot</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is one of the most overly complex and undocumented jekyll problems I’ve come across so far (apart from pagination - but I try to block that out of my memory).

This has been about a year in the making, and I’m really happy with how it’s turned out. In the future, I’ll be posting all my programming, 3d-printing and othe r miscellaneous techie projects here. More pages are also due to be added in the future, as well as rss and newsletter capabilities.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-the-website-work">How does the website work?</h3>

<p>Well - it’s complicated. I started this project, trying to build a custom, plain HTML + CSS website, with a few python scripts to manage the blogging system - it went about as well as you’d expect, but I learned some valuable web development skills that are used in this final versions of the website. So, finally, I settled on using Jekyll for the backend. For hosting, I used GitHub pages, but using actions, instead of the default configuration. This was to allow me to use the jekyll-paginate-v2 and jekyll-sitemap plugins. My domain registrar is NameCheap, as they had the cheapest rate for this url, and I used CloudFlare free tier for DNS, caching and CDN purposes. Finally, the the aestetics are made using the fantastic <a href="https://jdan.github.io/98.css/">98.css</a> and Alex Meub’s <a href="https://win98icons.alexmeub.com/">Windows 98 Icon collection</a>.</p>

<p>So, expect more posts like this in the future (although, they’ll probably be longer next time) and more features to come.</p>]]></content><author><name>ProbablyIdiot</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, and welcome to the first post of my new website.
